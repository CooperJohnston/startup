# Cooper Johnston's CS260 Startup
Allowing you to find something worthwile to read, and appreciate what your friends think.

## The Pitch
We live in an age full of connection online, but not much of it is _postive._ Additonally, sites such as lettrboxd allow for users to share opinions on film and televsion. \Finally, Comic Books are larger than ever due to the massive mainstream success of Marvel Studios.
This startup will create a platform for users to review and reccomend books they have read, creating postive and enlightening discourse, and encouraging reading and understanding.
